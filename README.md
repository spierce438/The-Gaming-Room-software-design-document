# The-Gaming-Room-software-design-document
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room was a game in which players attempted to guess an image that slowly appeared over 30 seconds. There were a large amount of images that needed to be rendered, however the file sizes were rather low not requiring a large amount of memory storage.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did a greta job identifying the benefits of the various operating systems and ensured the correct one was selected based on the facts throughout the project.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

This process makes it simple to break everything down concisely. I found it particularly helpful when I was required to speak about the different operating systems and talking about each part individually of them including the server side and client side.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve and work on explaining my reasons and recommendations a little better at the end. This is an important part to the client and I could have been more detailed and descriptive. I think it's important to explain that in very descriptive language since you never know how knowledgeable the client is.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took into consideration all of the needs as far as the interface necessary, how each picture worked and would be loaded in slowly and also which operating systems have pros that would maximize potential and minimize poor performance.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached this project by taking in all the information the client had to offer and considering how this would work in a system. I will continue to analyze information all the way through so I can think through all the details. The benefit of doing so was that I was able to come up with the most ideal operating system to run this game as well as possible.
